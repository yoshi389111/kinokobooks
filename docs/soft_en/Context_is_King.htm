<h1>Context is King</h1>
</header>

<p>I feel there is a certain irony in trying to impart something about
architectural ideals, when the very premise I wish to begin with is
that effectively <i>there are no ideals</i>. If this is indeed the
case, then surely there is nothing to write, I am a contradiction and
by doing this I run the risk of the universe imploding or something
like that.
</p><p>But alas, <i>ceci n'est pas une pipe.</i>
One of the most valuable lessons that I have learned as a
software architect is that context is king, and simplicity its humble
servant. What this means in practical terms is that context is the only
force that trumps simplicity when making architectural decisions. 
When I say context, I refer not only to high-level, immediate
forces such as key business drivers, but also to elements in the
periphery, such as emerging technologies and thought leadership on
diverse topics. Indeed, good architects keep track of several
fast-moving targets. 
What constitutes good architecture? It is the product of
decisions made within a context usually tainted with multiple competing
priorities. Those competing priorities mean that sometimes the most
important decisions are not about what you put in, but rather what you
omit. The currency of good architecture is simply astute
decision-making (while the products are all only about communicating
your intent).
</p><p>Historically, there have been some fascinating examples of the
influence that context can have on architecture. A favorite example
involves the database selected to support an ambitious new software
system for a modern battlefield tank [1]. (Deciding what database to
use is not usually architecturally significant; this example merely
serves to illustrate a point).
</p><p>When it came time to choose the database, the team assessed
many. They found that while the tank was moving quickly over undulating
terrain while tracking a target, the majority of the databases were
capable of supporting this maximal throughput required of the
navigation and targeting systems. But they were taken by surprise when
they discovered that firing the main gun on the tank caused such a
strong electromagnetic pulse that it totally crashed the on-board
systems and of course the database along with it! On a modern
battlefield, a tank without its software running is quite literally in
the dark. In this context, <i>recovery time</i> was the overwhelming
factor in the choice of database, and no database did that better at
the time than InterBase [2], and that is why it was chosen for the M1
Abrams tank.
</p><p>So, while newsgroups rage with the flames of technology debates
of X vs Y, it is idle amusement. The reason these debates rage is often
not because of huge disparities in their technical merits, but rather
because there are more subtle differences between them, and what
features individuals value more than others when there is no guiding <i>context</i> to act as a trump card. 
</p><p>Your team should be free of ideals, reflect on context in the first instance, and reach for the simplest solutions from there.
