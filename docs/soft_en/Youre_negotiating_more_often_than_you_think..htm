<h1>You're negotiating more often than you think.</h1>
</header>

<p>We've all been hit with budgetecture. That's when sound technology
choices go out the window in favor of cost-cutting. The conversation
goes something like this.
</p><p>"Do we really need X?" asks the project sponsor.
</p><p>For "X", you can substitute nearly anything that's vitally
necessary to make the system run: software licenses, redundant servers,
offsite backups, or power supplies. It's always asked with a sort of
paternalistic tone, as though the grown-up has caught us blowing all
our pocket money on comic books and bubble gum, whilst the serious
adults are trying to get on with buying more buckets to carry their
profits around in.
</p><p>The correct way to answer this is "Yes.  We do."  That's almost never the response.
</p><p>After all, we're trained as engineers, and engineering is all
about making trade-offs. We know good and well that you don't really
need extravagances like power supplies, so long as there's a sufficient
supply of hamster wheels and cheap interns in the data center. So
instead of saying, "Yes. We do," we say something like, "Well, you
could do without a second server, provided you're willing to accept
downtime for routine maintenance and whenever a parity bit flips,
causing a crash, but if we get error-checking parity memory then we get
around that, so we just have to worry about the operating system
crashing, which it does about every three-point-nine days, so we'll
have to do nightly restart. The interns can do that whenever they get a
break from the power-generating hamster wheels."
</p><p>All of which might be completely true, but is utterly the wrong
thing to say. The sponsor stopped listening right after the word
"well."
</p><p>The problem is that you see your part as an engineering role, while your sponsor clearly understands he's engaged in a <i>negotiation</i>.
We're looking for a collaborative solution-finding exercise; they're
looking for a win-lose tactical maneuver. And in a negotiation, the
last thing you want to do is make concessions on the first demand. In
fact, the right response to the "do we really need" question is
something like this:
</p><p>"Without a second server, the whole system will come crashing
down at least three times daily, particularly when it's under heaviest
load or when you are doing a demo for the Board of Directors. In fact,
we really need four servers so we can take one HA pair down
independently at any time while still maintaining 100% of our capacity,
even in case one of the remaining pair crashes unexpectedly."
</p><p>Of course, we both know you don't really need the third and
fourth servers. This is a counter-negotiating gambit to get the sponsor
to change the subject to something else. You're upping the ante and
showing that you're already running at the bare, dangerous,
nearly-irresponsible minimum tolerable configuration. And besides, if
you do actually get the extra servers, you can certainly use one to
make your QA environment match production, and the other will make a
great build box.
