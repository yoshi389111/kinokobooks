<h1>Simplicity before generality, use before reuse</h1>
</header>
<p>A common problem in component frameworks, class libraries,
foundation services, and other infrastructure code is that many are
designed to be general purpose without reference to concrete
applications. This leads to a dizzying array of options and
possibilities that are often unused, misused, or just not useful. Most
developers work on specific systems: the quest for unbounded generality
rarely serves them well (if at all). The best route to generality is
through understanding known, specific examples and focusing on their
essence to find an essential common solution. Simplicity through
experience rather than generality through guesswork.
</p><p>Favoring simplicity before generality acts as a tiebreaker
between otherwise equally viable design alternatives. When there are
two possible solutions, favor the one that is simpler and based on
concrete need rather than the more intricate one that boasts of
generality. Of course, it is entirely possible (and more than a little
likely) that the simpler solution will turn out to be the more general
one in practice. And if that doesn't turn out to be the case, it will
be easier to change the simpler solution to what you now know you need
than to change the 'general' one that turns out not to be quite general
enough in the right way.
</p><p>Although well meant, many things that are designed just to be
general purpose often end up satisfying no purpose. Software components
should, first and foremost, be designed for use and to fulfill that use
well. Effective generality comes from understanding, and understanding
leads to simplification. Generalization can allow us to reduce a
problem to something more essential, resulting in an approach that
embodies regularity across known examples, a regularity that is crisp,
concise, and well grounded. However, too often generalization becomes a
work item in itself, pulling in the opposite direction, adding to the
complexity rather than reducing it. The pursuit of speculative
generality often leads to solutions that are not anchored in the
reality of actual development. They are based on assumptions that later
turn out to be wrong, offer choices that later turn out not to be
useful, and accumulate baggage that becomes difficult or impossible to
remove, thereby adding to the accidental complexity developers and
future architects must face.
</p><p>Although many architects value generality, it should not be
unconditional. People do not on the whole pay for (or need) generality:
They tend to have a specific situation, and it is a solution to that
specific situation that has value. We can find generality and
flexibility in trying to deliver specific solutions, but if we weigh
anchor and forget the specifics too soon, we end up adrift in a sea of
nebulous possibilities, a world of tricky configuration options,
overburdened (not just overloaded) parameter lists, long-winded
interfaces, and not-quite right abstractions. In pursuit of arbitrary
flexibility you can often lose valuable properties, accidental or
intended, of alternative, simpler designs.
