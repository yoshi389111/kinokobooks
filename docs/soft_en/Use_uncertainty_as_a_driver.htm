<h1>Use uncertainty as a driver</h1>
</header>

<p>Confronted with two options, most people think that the most
important thing to do is to make a choice between them. In design
(software or otherwise), it is not. The presence of two options is an
indicator that you need to consider uncertainty in the design. Use the
uncertainty as a driver to determine where you can defer commitment to
details and where you can partition and abstract to reduce the
significance of design decisions. If you hardwire the first thing that
comes to mind you're more likely to be stuck with it, so that
incidental decisions become significant and the softness of the
software is reduced.
</p><p>One of the simplest and most constructive definitions of architecture comes from Grady Booch:
"All architecture is design but not all design is architecture.
Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a
system, where significant is measured by cost of change." What follows
from this is that an effective architecture is one that generally
reduces the significance of design decisions. An ineffective
architecture will amplify significance.
</p><p>When a design decision can reasonably go one of two ways, an
architect needs to take a step back. Instead of trying to decide
between options A and B, the question becomes "How do I design so that
the choice between A and B is less significant?" The most interesting
thing is not actually the choice between A and B, but the fact that
there is a choice between A and B (and that the appropriate choice is
not necessarily obvious or stable).
</p><p>An architect may need to go in circles before becoming dizzy
and recognizing the dichotomy. Standing at whiteboard (energetically)
debating options with a colleague? Umming and ahhing in front of some
code, deadlocked over whether to try one implementation or another?
When a new requirement or a clarification of a requirement has cast
doubt on the wisdom of a current implementation, that's uncertainty.
Respond by figuring out what separation or encapsulation would isolate
that decision from the code that ultimately depends on it. Without this
sensibility the alternative response is often rambling code that, like
a nervous interviewee, babbles away trying to compensate for
uncertainty with a multitude of speculative and general options. Or,
where a response is made with arbitrary but unjustified confidence, a
wrong turn is taken at speed and without looking back.
</p><p>There is often pressure to make a decision for decision's sake.
This is where options thinking can help. Where there is uncertainty
over different paths a system's development might take, make the
decision not to make a decision. Defer the actual decision until a
decision can be made more responsibly, based on actual knowledge, but
not so late that it is not possible to take advantage of the knowledge.
</p><p>Architecture and process are interwoven, which is a key reason
that architects should favor development lifecycles and architectural
approaches that are empirical and elicit feedback, using uncertainty
constructively to divide up both the system and the schedule.
