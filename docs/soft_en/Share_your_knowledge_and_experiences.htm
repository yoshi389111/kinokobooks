<h1>Share your knowledge and experiences</h1>
</header>

<p>From
all of our experiences, including both success and failure, we learn a
great deal. In a young industry like software development,
disseminating this experience and knowledge is vital in helping sustain
progress. What each team learns in its own tiny little corner of the
world is possibly influential across the globe. 
</p><p>Realistically
our fundamental knowledge base for software development, that is, the
knowledge that is absolute and theoretically correct, is small compared
to what is necessary to successfully develop a project. To
compensate,we guess, rely on intuitive judgments or even pick randomly.
In that, any major development project generates empirical evidence
into what works and what fails. We're gradually working through the
permutations, which we want to apply back to industry as a whole.
</p><p>At
an individual level, we are all trying to grow and come to understand
how to build larger and larger systems. The course of our careers will
take us toward ever-increasing challenges, for which we want our past
experiences to help guide us. Being there is one thing, but to get the
most from the experience we often have to rationalize it. The best and
easiest way of working through it is to attempt to explain it to
another person. 
</p><p>The act of discussing
something always helps to show its weaknesses.You don't really
understand something, until you can explain it easily. It's only by
putting forth our explanations and discussing them that we solidify the
experience into knowledge.
</p><p>Another point
is that while we may have had specific experiences, the inferences we
draw from them may not be entirely correct in the overall context. We
may not have been as successful as we thought, or as smart as we
wanted. Of course testing your knowledge against the real world is
scary, particularly when you find out that something dear is myth,
incorrect or was never true; it's hard to be wrong.
</p><p>Ultimately,
we are human beings so not everything in our minds is correct; not
every thought we have is reasonable. It's only when we accept our flaws
that we open up the possibility of improving. The old adage about
learning more from failure always holds. If our ideas and beliefs do
not stand the test of a debate, then it is better we find out now, than
build on it later.
</p><p>We really want to share
our knowledge and experience to help the industry progress; we also
realize it helps ourselves to understand and correct it. Given the
state of so much of our software, it is clearly important for us to
take every opportunity to share the things we know, what we think we
know, and what we've seen. If we help those around us to improve,
they'll help us to reach our full potential.
