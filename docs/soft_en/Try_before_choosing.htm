<h1>Try before choosing</h1>

<p>Creating an application requires many decisions to be made. Some
might involve choosing a framework or library while others revolve
around the use of specific design patterns. In either case the
responsibility for the decision generally lies with the architect on
the team. A stereotypical architect might gather all the information
that can be gathered, then mull over it for a while, and finally decree
the solution from the ivory tower for it to be implemented by the
developers. Not surprisingly there is a better way. 
In their work on lean development Mary and Tom Poppendieck
describe a technique for making decisions. They argue that we should
delay commitment until the last responsible moment, that is the moment
at which, if the team does not make a decision, it is made for them;
when inaction results in an outcome that is not (easily) reversible.
This is prudent because the later a decision is made the more
information is available on which to base the decision. However, in
many cases more information is not the same as enough information, and
we also know that the best decisions are made in hindsight. What does
this mean for the good architect?
</p><p>The architect should constantly be on the look out for
decisions that will have to be made soon. Provided the team has more
than a handful of developers and practices collective code ownership
the architect can, when such a decision point approaches, ask several
developers to come up with a solution to the problem and go with it for
a while. As the last responsible moment arrives the team gets together
and assesses the benefits and drawbacks of the different soutions.
Usually, now with the benefit of hindsight, the best solution to the
problem is apparent to everybody. The architect does not have to make
the decision, he or she merely orchestrates the decision making
process. 
This approach works for small decisions as well as for large
ones. It can allow a team to figure out whether or not to use the
Hibernate templates provided by the Spring framework but it can equally
answer the question of which JavaScript framework to use. The duration
for which the different approaches evolve is obviously very dependent
on the complexity of the decision.
</p><p>Trying two or even more approaches to the same problem requires
more effort than making a decision upfront and then just implementing
one. However, chances are that an upfront decision leads to a solution
that is later recognized to be sub-optimal, leaving the architect with
a dilemma: either the team rolls back the current implementation or
they live with the consequences, both of which result in wasted effort.
Even worse, it is entirely possible that nobody on the team recognizes
that the approach chosen is not the best one, because none of the
alternatives were explored. In this case effort is wasted without any
chance of addressing the waste. After all, trying multiple approaches
might be the least expensive option.
